                                <p>Nobody knows for sure how the statues were moved, but scientist have tested a few theories. They believe that the statues were moved using combination of log rollers, ropes and wooden sledges.</p>

                                <p>In 2008, Marko Kulju, a finnish tourist was found on Anakena beach hacking off a ear of one of the moai's.</p>
                                <p>After being captured for his crime, he was placed under house arrest and fined nearly 17,000 USD.</p>

                                <h4>The statues may have been an antidote to leprosy</h4>
                                <p>Dr Anneliese Pontius, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, hypotheses the shock of seeing deformity on the features most important in social interaction (face, hand, fingers, arms) may have driven islanders to ritually ‘undo’ the damage by creating moai with over-corrected features.</p>
                                <p>The symptoms of leprosy vs. their over-corrected moai equivalents are listed below, as described in Dr Pontius’s paper:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Leprosy’s destruction of the nose cartilage is countered by pronounced noses and stylised nostrils.</li>
                                    <li>Downward placement of the mouth with lower hanging lip and bared teeth (due to facial nerve paralysis) vs. moai’s upward placement of the lips. No teeth visible.</li>
                                    <li>Lips retracted and swollen vs. pursed upward and thin.</li>
                                    <li>"Claw hand” vs. extended fingers in a straight fashion. The elongated fingers lie in a horizontal line across the abdomen.</li>
                                    <li>Disturbances of fingers and nails vs. moai’s well delineated fingertips and nails.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                <p>This is perhaps the most curious of all the interesting Easter Island facts. All the statues on Easter Island have distinctive elongated features and follow a certain aesthetic. Tukuturi, however, seems far more human. It is far smaller than the other moai and seems to be in a kneeling position with its hands on its legs.</p>
                                <p>Tukuturi’s head is round and more human-like and appears to have a small beard. What’s more, while the other moai were carved at the stunning site of Rano Raraku, Tukuturi was made from a different material (the reddish stone of Puna Pua) and then brought to Rano Raraku. No-one knows why it’s so different.</p>

                                <h4>The statues were toppled by angry islanders</h4>
                                <p>No-one argues that at one stage in its history, Easter Island went through a devastating deforestation. The prevailing theory has long been that the islanders felled (or burned) trees to clear land and carve canoes to serve the growing population, and possibly to transport the moai.</p>
                                <p>More recent theories suggest that the wide-scale deforestation was the work of Polynesian rats that came over with the first canoes. What anthropologists do agree on is that at some point in the 1700s, there was a rebellion or rioting by the islanders.</p>
                                <p>Tired of dwindling resources, clans began to clash, tearing down each other’s moais. It’s reported that by 1868, there were no upright statues on the island apart from the partially buried ones on the outer slopes of Rano Raraku. Many have of course since been re-erected.</p>

                        <li>Known as Rapa Nui to its earliest inhabitants, the island was christened Paaseiland, or Easter Island, by Dutch explorers in honor of the day of their arrival in 1722.</li>
                        <li>It was annexed by Chile in the late 19th century and now maintains an economy based largely on tourism.</li>
                        <li>The first human inhabitants of the Eastern Island are believed to have arrived in an organized party of emigrants. Archaeology dates their arrival at between 700-800 A.D.</li>
